# LangChain-Q-A-ChatBot
This repository is all about creating a Chat Bot using Open AI API key and also from the HuggingFace Open source Secret Key based on the LangChain which is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. 

You can see the three files.
1. requirements.text where the necessary libraries are mentioned
2. langchain.ipynb, all the library installation, API keys, call LLM models with the help of HuggingFace and Open AI APIs:
- Prompt Templates and LLM Chain,
- Combining Multiple Chains Using Simple Sequential Chain,
- Sequential Chain,
- ChatModels with ChatOpenAI,
- Prompt Template + LLM + Output Parsers

3. app.py where we have used the streamlit framework and is free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps. It is a Python-based library specifically designed for machine learning engineers.
